# Documentation Index

This directory contains detailed documentation for the Sonar System.

## Documents

| Document | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| [Architecture](architecture.md) | System design, component boundaries, data flow |
| [Sensors](sensors.md) | Sensor abstraction, implementations, extension points |
| [Filters](filters.md) | Signal processing pipeline, filter types, composition |
| [Visualization](visualization.md) | Radar types, comparison mode, display options |

## Reading Order

Start with the README in the project root. It provides context for why the system exists and what problems it addresses.

These documents assume familiarity with that context. They focus on the reasoning behind specific design choices rather than repeating the overview.

## Conventions

Each document follows the same structure:

1. **Scope** — What the document covers
2. **Responsibilities** — What the component does and does not do
3. **Design Rationale** — Why it works this way
4. **Interface** — How to use or extend it

Implementation details appear only when they clarify intent.
